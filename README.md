# From the Dark Years to the Golden Years

My grandmother wrote an autobiography before her passing. As my way of honoring her, I transcribed her book into the form of a website so that it may be more accessable to my family members.

This book is live at [darktogolder.justbunch.com](https://darktogolden.justbunch.com/)

This site was built with the [Solid.js](https://solidjs.com/) framework.
