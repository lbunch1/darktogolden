<BookPage title="Acknowledgements">

It was my daughter, Brenda Bunch, who inspired me to put my words on paper.  She listened to my stories and urged me to write this book for my children and grandchildren.  She has guided me and supported me all the way from the first page to the last page, including editing and final formatting.

I want to thank my son, Dale Dillon Bunch jr., for the printing and binding of this book. I also owe him my heartfelt appreciation for helping me to recover the entire manuscript when I accidently deleted it one evening. 

I will always be grateful to my friend, Karen Hinton, who is herself a writer, for doing the proofreading of this book.
