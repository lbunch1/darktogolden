As Assistant Professor she taught courses in the School of Education for three years.  Then she took a position as Head of the Mathematics Department at the Barstow School.  When she reached the age of fifty-five she joined the business world and worked as a Computer Programmer Analyst for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, Missouri.  After retiring from Hallmark they moved to Phoenix, Arizona.  There she taught College Algebra for several years at the Glendale Community College.
