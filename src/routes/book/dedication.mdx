<BookPage title="Dedication">

This book is dedicated to my parents who guided my sister and me through years when their own financial circumstances were meager and their future looked dim.  They spared us from their concerns yet, at the same time, made certain that we had the good things in life that children need. 

	 
	For several years I thought about writing this book because I wanted to create for my own children and grandchildren a record of what life was like during the bad times as well as the good times.  The story is starts in 1923 and ends in the mid 1970â€™s.

It was not until the fall of 2012 that I began to write, but once I began to put words on paper, the memories came flooding back.  These memories were so vivid that I felt compelled to write.  At times, it seemed like the memories were writing this book while I looked on.
