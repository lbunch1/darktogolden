<img src="/images/image59.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 20ch;" />There were many different styles of bungalows built in the 1920’s and 30’s.  The type of bungalow that Cecil and his father built is a one-story house with living room, dining room, three bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen with breakfast room, full basement and a porch that wrapped around the side of the house.  The address is 115 East 65th Terrace and is listed as a residence in Armour Hills.  It is not a large house, only 1300 square feet.  I have no memory of the acquisition of furniture, kitchen appliances, a telephone, and an automobile, but they were all there as far back as I can remember.
The only photo of the interior is a photo of the Dining Room.

<div style="clear: right"></div>My father drove a 1924 Chrysler sedan, like the one in this photo.  To me it looked like a big brown box with running boards. That happens to be Mr. Chrysler standing next to it.

I was born in December of 1924 and my presence brought about changes in the household.  My father became the sole breadwinner and paid the bills. My mother became a full-time stay-at-home-mom. Two and one-half years later my sister, Jean was born.

Now Mother, with two babies to care for, was in charge of the laundry, grocery shopping, dressing, bathing and feeding the children. With all this responsibility, she thought she needed some help with running the household. In those days household help was easy to find and very reasonable.  She used the telephone to call an agency, explained what she needed and in few days a lady would show up to help her.
